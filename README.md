I am a software developer with 17 years of development experience. I started my career on the Technical University of Vienna. Working in the department for Software engineering sharpened my knowledge about software-development processes. With a strong coding background over multiple programming-languages I started to focus on automation of processes and continuous integration/deployment as a working practise together with building the needed infrastructure.
Currently my focus is on supporting the development of continuous integration within Bosch both on the side of the needed transformation from a tool based world over to the continuous way as well as implementing services and plugins for different infrastructures.
