I am a software developer with 23 years of development experience. I started my career on the Technical University of Vienna. Working in the department for Software engineering sharpened my knowledge about software-development processes. With a strong coding background over multiple programming-languages I started to focus on automation of processes and continuous integration/deployment as a working practise together with building the needed infrastructure.
Currently my focus is on supporting the development of continuous integration within Bosch both on the side of the needed transformation from a tool based world over to the continuous way as well as implementing services and plugins for different infrastructures.

# work experience

## Technical University of Vienna
### 2002 - 2005
In my role as an assistant to the lecturing tutor, I wrote and reviewed scripts for lectures, wrote and reviewed exams, and held weekly meetings with groups of students to monitor their progress and help them prepare for the exams. During that time, I was already working in the field of Software Development Processes, getting my hands on a copy of 'Extreme Programming' by Kent Beck, which fueled my mind with ideas on how to improve work.
