**Software developer** with 25 years of experience. I started my path at TU Wien in Software Engineering and later founded ChiliCode, combining academic rigour with entrepreneurship. I care about solid processes, automation, and continuous integration as a daily practice, not just as tools.

Today I support continuous integration across Bosch: guiding the shift from tool-centric workflows to a truly continuous way of working, and building services and plugins for diverse infrastructures. I aim to help teams ship better, more reliably.

# Work Experience

## Technical University of Vienna
### 2002 - 2005
In my role as an assistant to the lecturing tutor, I wrote and reviewed scripts for lectures, wrote and reviewed exams, and held weekly meetings with groups of students to monitor their progress and help them prepare for the exams. During that time, I was already working in the field of Software Development Processes, getting my hands on a copy of 'Extreme Programming' by Kent Beck, which fueled my mind with ideas on how to improve work.

## Bosch
### 2005 - 2022
As a consultant at Bosch, I support the DELib Team, which supplies a single-source library for actuators and sensors to customers in the automotive sector worldwide. My main responsibilities have evolved from automating code generation and configuration-based code generation to implementing continuous integration as a work practice. Currently, my focus is on supporting the development of continuous integration within Bosch, both in terms of the necessary transformation from a tool-based environment to a continuous integration approach, as well as implementing services and plugins for different infrastructures.

## ChiliCode
### 2007 - now
ChiliCode is a small Austrian software development and IT support company. We provide IT support and consultancy to our customers, helping them build IT infrastructure such as networks and backup strategies. We assist with installing, creating, and maintaining homepages, as well as creating mobile office solutions (webmail, web calendar, contacts, etc.). We develop custom software solutions for administrative tasks, web applications, and software to support their daily work. Additionally, we are involved in the development of various types of applications, ranging from database servers with synchronization to Java applications, web applications, and iOS apps. We build private cloud solutions for our customers and consult with them on the use of modern tools and applications according to their needs.

## ChiliCode
### 2023 - now
As a holder of a 'Certified Digital Consultant' certification, I am authorized to support and conduct publicly funded projects for and with my customers to assist them on their journey to digitalization.

## Bosch
### 2022 - now
In my role as a 'Technical Expert' for Continuous Development Methods and Operations, I work with my team, which is spread across Germany, Austria, India, and Vietnam, to enable 20,000 developers to work with modern methodologies and state-of-the-art tools while fulfilling our legislative requirements for creating embedded software for the automotive industry.

## Bosch
### 2024 - now
Since September 2024, I have officially also taken on the role of Head of Agile Planning Strategy in our department. My focus is on fostering the right mindset and culture, along with the most important basics of agility, within the organization.


# Special Highlights

### GSVF 2019
Speaker at the Grazer Symposion for Virtual Vehicle. Topic: Continuous Integration across roles and organizational units. Presenting the approach we choose at Bosch on how to scale Continuous Integration from small teams across multiple continents.

### GSVF 2021
Speaker with a talk about Scaling Continuous Integration from local teams, over on-premise server farms to public cloud. In this presentation I describe what parameters we use to decide where to run what and which boundaries we have to take care of on our way into the cloud.
I also lead a round-table discussion about Continuous Integration as Driver for the Transformation from a Document Driven to a Data Driven Business where I elaborated with the participants on where we gained deeper knowledge about our business processes when we moved from a document, mostly excel based approach to a data-driven approach supported by databases, data-lakes and data-warehouses.

### QED 2025
Speaker at [QED](https://qed.croz.net). As a software engineer at Bosch with 25 years of experience, I recently spoke about a key project: building a new collaboration and development environment for Bosch Mobility. A central theme of my talk was scaling this ecosystem from 500 to a potential 20,000 developers. I discussed how we develop and integrate software solutions, working with cross-functional teams to align components with hardware and uphold Bosch's quality standards. For the past two decades, I've focused on creating a better ecosystem for developers, fostering innovation and efficiency. My presentation highlighted this ongoing commitment to improving our processes and tackling technical challenges.
